👋 Hi, I’m Brent, also known as @brentscripts!
- 👀 I’m a junior software developer passionate about using C# and .NET to solve problems and build impactful software.
- 🌱 Currently exploring Git, Docker, Azure, Blazor, and ASP.NET Core Apps to expand my skill set.
- 💞️ I’m open to feedback and discussions on my practice projects as I learn and grow in the software development journey.
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on LinkedIn — I'd love to network!
- ⚡ Fun Fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll find me crafting pallet wood habitats 🏡 for my kids’ pet ducks 🦆 and chickens 🐓!
