- 👋 Hi, I’m Brent @brentscripts
- 👀 I’m a junior C# programmer and software developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, Docker, Azure, Functional Programming, Blazor and ASP.NET Core Apps.
- 💞️ I’m open to feedback and discussions on my practice projects as I explore and grow in the world of software development. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect on LinkedIn.
- ⚡ **Fun Fact:** When I'm not coding, I spend a lot of time building pallet wood habitats 🏡 for my children's pet ducks 🦆 and chickens 🐓!
